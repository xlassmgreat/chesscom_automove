# chesscom_automove
Automover for chesscom on Firefox

## Installtion
This project is still under development. It is not a well made plugin yet. If you want to try it, [load it as a temporary plugin](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/).

It has two dependencies: [Chess.com Movehelper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chess-com-keyboard/) and [Eeing](https://github.com/xlassmgreat/eeing). Make sure you install both.

## Usage
This only works on the URL https://www.chess.com/play/computer and nothing else. Press Control to start playing (that will remain the keybinding until something more permanent is decided).
