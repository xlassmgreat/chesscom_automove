# chesscom_automove
Automover for chesscom on Firefox

## Installtion
This project is still under development. It is not a well made plugin yet. If you want to try it, use the .xpi file provided in the [releases](https://github.com/xlassmgreat/chesscom_automove/releases/).

It has two dependencies: [Chess.com Movehelper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chess-com-keyboard/) and [Eeing](https://github.com/xlassmgreat/eeing). Make sure you install both.

## Usage
This only works on the URL https://www.chess.com/play/computer and nothing else. Press Control to start playing (that will remain the keybinding until something more permanent is decided). Make sure your move notation in Chesscom is set to Text, and not Figurine.
