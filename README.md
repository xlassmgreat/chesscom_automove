# chesscom_automove
Automover for chesscom on Firefox

## Installtion
This project is still under development. It is not a well made plugin yet. If you want to try it, use the .xpi file provided in the [releases](https://github.com/xlassmgreat/chesscom_automove/releases/).

It has two dependencies: [Chess.com Movehelper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chess-com-keyboard/) and [Eeing](https://github.com/xlassmgreat/eeing). Make sure you install both.

## Usage
The plugin is activated in all URLs starting with https://www.chess.com/play/. Press e to connect to engine and transfer moves to the board. For subsequent matches (if you haven't reloaded the page), press s instead (this won't open a new connection with the native app and engine). Make sure your move notation in Chesscom is set to Text, and not Figurine.
